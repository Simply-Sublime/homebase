# This config is focused on classified names.
#
# When a new client is spawned, it checks its name against
# any of the classifiers.  If there's a match, it will use
# the name specified.  If not, the desktop name will be 
# a space separated string of opened clients.  All empty 
# desktops will use the constant name
